## Key Features
- **Secure User Account Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user accounts, complete with a password security check for sensitive actions.
- **Complete Food Inventory Management:** Full CRUD operations for food items, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete their stored goods.
- **Intelligent Item Coding:** Items are automatically assigned a unique code based on storage location (D-#### for Dry, F-#### for Freezer), which updates dynamically if the location is changed.
- **At-a-Glance Dashboard:** The application opens to a dashboard that immediately highlights items that have already expired or are expiring within the next 7 days.
- **Real-time Search:** A live search bar on the "View All Items" page allows users to instantly filter their entire inventory by name.
- **Automated Email Summaries:** Upon exiting, users receive an automated email summarizing the status of their expiring and expired items.
- **Professional Installer:** The application is distributed via a ClickOnce installer (setup.exe) that handles all dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** .NET 8

- **User Interface:** Windows Forms (WinForms)

## My Learning Journey

This project was a comprehensive exercise in migrating a fully functional console application to a modern, event-driven GUI application using Windows Forms. It strengthened my skills in Object-Oriented Programming, robust file handling for data persistence, and designing an intuitive, user-friendly interface. A key challenge and learning experience was refactoring the original console-based logic into decoupled services (Validation_Service.cs) that could be reused effectively within the GUI's event-based architecture. Implementing features like the security check and the ClickOnce installer provided valuable insight into building secure, distributable, real-world applications.
